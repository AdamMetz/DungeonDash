## Dungeon Dash
“Dungeon Dash” is a single player 2D dungeon-crawler/roguelike adventure game, with a pixelated and medieval fantasy theme. The player embarks on a journey through a series of unique rooms within a dungeon, where their skills are put to the test as they are confronted by many monsters. 

The player can choose from three different classes for their adventure: Archer, Mage, and Warrior. Each of these classes has their own unique playstyle, and the players can heavily customize their experience with the many interesting items within the game. As the player traverses the dungeon, they will find new weapons, armour, and accessories, that augment and shape the players approach to combat and survival. After the player battles their way to the end of the dungeon, they are met with a final boss to complete the game. However, the player's adventure doesn’t end here, as they can traverse the dungeon again as a new class, and try out new weapons, armour, and accessories. 

The controls for the game consist of WASD/Arrow Keys for directional movement, and the use of spacebar or left-click for attacking. Players will have to position themselves carefully, to avoid the onslaught of attacks from the various monsters throughout the dungeon. Inspirations for this game include popular games such as [Tiny Rogues](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088570/Tiny_Rogues/) and [Realm of the Mad God](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200210/Realm_of_the_Mad_God_Exalt/).
